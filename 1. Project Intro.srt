00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,960
What's going on guys.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,500
Welcome to your first project.

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,960
So I wanted to do something pretty simple but something that's pretty common for the first project of

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,720
the course.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,160
And we're gonna do a form validator.

6
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,540
So we're gonna do some client side form validation and we'll first create the form with each team out

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,930
then we're gonna style it with CSX and then we're gonna go ahead and add our javascript now to begin

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,170
with.

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,780
We're gonna do this kind of I guess the easy way but not the best code.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,820
Just a bunch of if statements with some validation and then we're going to completely refactor it and

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,570
create specific functions for each type of validation for instance to check required or check the length

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,370
or check to see if the passwords match.

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,840
So we'll write it in one way and then we'll completely refactor it to make it cleaner and make it more

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,250
scalable if we want to add more fields it'll be easy to add the validation.

15
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,150
OK so just to give you an example here.

16
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,830
If I were to submit I get a bunch of errors.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,240
So every field is required.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,990
Some of them have a men and max length so user name must be at least three characters.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,880
If I type in Brad and submit you'll see that that's now highlighted green which means that it passed

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,490
for the email.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:22,220
So if I just type in anything that's not going to work I to test at test dot com that's going to pass.

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:29,820
Now for the password has to be at least six characters if I do let's do three characters and submit

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,770
you'll see it still get that error.

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,310
Also the passwords don't match and they have to.

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:42,940
So it's two three four five six one two three four five six submit and now they both pass.

26
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,680
OK so we'll be dealing with JavaScript along with CSX because obviously we need to add certain classes

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,260
to make this green or red or display or hide the error messages.

28
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,650
So we're gonna go ahead and get started.
